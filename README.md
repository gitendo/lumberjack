# Lumberjack
Here's Game Boy version of Amiga / C64 mini game I did for [RetroKomp / Load Error 2017](http://www.pouet.net/party.php?which=1663&when=2017) gamedev compo.

It was coded in assembly in about two weeks of spare time, mostly to have some low level fun. Source code is a bit messy since I prototyped a lot during the process - wasn't sure if I manage to get graphics, etc. Also, I don't use RGBASM, so I guess releasing it in its current state makes no sense unless.. this repo is starred by many people. ;) ROM image is available from releases page. As usual, use real hardware! Emulators are for developement purposes and kill half of the fun, really...
